## TmuxCS

Tmux CS (Cheat Sheet) is a CLI tmux reference written in Rust that will help people that begin using tmux to use it efficiently.

The information is grabbed from the [Tmux Cheat Sheet & Quick Reference]() and adapted to the markdown format (all the .md files are placed in /markdown).
Therefore the program just prints out the markdown files' content to the terminal.
